IMPORTANT NOTE : Unfortunately I happened to overlook the section in the assignment that stated all features must be committed seperately.
There are many features here that are individually committed but there are many that are not. Still, every feature listed here IS included in the game.

I currently have no idea how to go about going back and re-adding then committing every single feature individually, so I have not done that here.

I am aware this will likely dock many points from this project's final grade but I simply do not have enough time to redo everything.
